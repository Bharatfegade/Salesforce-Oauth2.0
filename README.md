# Salesforce OAuth2.0 Authentication

Created a Custom Login In React-Native to access the Resources of the Salesforce without using Salesforce Mobile SDK. Main motive of this implementation is to demonstrate the Salesforce Integration without Salesforce Mobile SDK.

## Usage Instructions

To create and work this approach first we have to do some configurations at the Salesforce side. To check how we can achieve that head over to the following documentation link where you can find the all step by step setup of salesforce side.

[Documentation of Salesforce Configuration](https://github.com/Bharatfegade/Salesforce-Oauth2.0/blob/main/salesforce-guide/Salesforce-OAuth2.0-Authentication.pdf)

Step 1: Replace the client_id and client_secret with your client_crendentials inside clien-secret.ts

Step 2: Replace the domain url with your domain url in domain-url.ts

Step 3: And then run the application.
